# Remote access of a system to another system.

This project allows us to control a desktop remotely from another system, it is developed in java.

Run the server side code (Server_side/start.java) on the system which is to be controlled and set a suitable password for it, then run the client side code(Client_side/start.java) on another desktop or system and enter the IP Address of the server desktop and enter the password, if IP and passwords match we can remotely control the system from another one.

Note - Connect both systems on the same IP Address.
